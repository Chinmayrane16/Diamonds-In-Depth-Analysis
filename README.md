# Diamonds-In-Depth-Analysis
**Diamonds**
* Given dataset of Diamonds with features such as Cut, Carat, Clarity etc. 
* I have used Libraries such as _Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn_ to Analyse and Estimate the **Price of Diamonds** based on the features.
* Used _Scikit-Learn_ to implement Regression models to improve the **R2 Score**.
* Analyzed and Visualized both the distribution of Categorical and Numerical Features.
* Used StandardScaler to Scale the numerical values.
* Finally, I have Tuned the Parameters with the help of _GridSearchCV_.
